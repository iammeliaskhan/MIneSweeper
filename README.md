## Board Customization

You can customize the size of the board and the number of mines by clicking on the **Customize** button. This will open a modal where you can input your desired values. The board size can range from 5x5 to 30x30, while the number of mines can range from 1 to 500.

## Difficulty Levels

## Timer

The game includes a timer that starts when you begin playing and stops when you either win or lose. The timer is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen.

You can flag cells that you suspect contain a mine by right-clicking on them. This will place a flag on the cell. You can remove the flag by right-clicking on the cell again.

## Resetting the Game

You can reset the game by clicking on the **Reset** button. This will clear the board and start a new game with the same settings.

## Dynamic Board Size
